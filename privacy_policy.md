## 1. Information We Handle

The Extension is designed to minimize data handling. We **do not collect or store any of your personal information**.

To provide its features, the Extension processes the following information:

- **Ticket ID:** The Extension reads the ticket ID directly from the Tidio URL you are currently viewing.

## 2. How Information Is Used

The information handled by the Extension is used solely to facilitate its core functionality:

- The **Ticket ID** is sent to a third-party Google Apps Script to fetch a relevant suggested reply.
- A subsequent request is sent to the same Google Apps Script to mark the reply as having been used.
- At no point is this information sent to us or any server we control.

## 3. Data Storage

- The Extension **does not store any data** locally in your browser. All information is processed in real-time and discarded.
- If you uninstall the Extension, no data needs to be removed as none is stored.

The Extension interacts with the following third-party services to function:
